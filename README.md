# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive website where users can filter through tables of data easily. 

## Results: 
The website displays numerous information on UFO sightings around the country. To easily search for specific search criteria, users can enter the criteria into the filter fields to find what they are looking for.

#### <kbd>→</kbd>The fourth filter option is by the country the sightings were reported in, but since all of the data contains reports from only in the US, this filter does not do too much.<kbd>←</kbd>

#### <kbd>↓</kbd> The fifth filter option is by the shape of the sighting reported.

## Summary: 
One drawback about this new design is the country filter. Since all of the sightings took place in the US, it is an unnecessary filter to have on the page. A couple additions to this page would help improve it some: gathering more data for sightings outside of the country and adding photos or video clips of the sightings to the table.
